*Note: Not actively being worked on.*

## Overview

A C++ library for working with [App Containers](https://github.com/appc/spec). The goal of the
libary is to be a flexible toolkit: manifest parsing and creation, pluggable discovery, image
creation / extraction / caching, thin-provisioned file systems, etc...not a particular
[ACE](https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#app-container-executor) implementation. In
other words, the goal is that you can use it to make one. Some or all pieces may be used, just use
the headers you require.

## Getting Started

Requires libarchive, libcurl, and functional std::regex (If using gcc, >= 4.9)

1. Bootstrap it (download and build dependencies): `./bootstrap.sh`
2. Run the tests: `./test.sh`
3. Build the examples: `./build.sh`

### With [biicode](https://www.biicode.com)

1. Run `bii buzz` command
2. Run examples on `bin/` directory

## Status

Early, early (like really early) development. Many pieces are incomplete and require tests, build
scripts need work, use of syntax likely inconsistent, etc.

Components that exist in some form:
- Schema parsing and validation
- Discovery (Simple, Local, no Meta)
- ACI inspection and extraction

## Examples

Example code is located in src/examples. Run `build.sh` and the examples will be built in
bin/examples, e.g.

```
$ ./build.sh

$ ./bin/examples/schema/generate_complete_crm > /tmp/container.json
